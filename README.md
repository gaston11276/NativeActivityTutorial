NativeActivityTutorial
======================

Android Native Activity examples, tutorials and testing.

Starting from the C4Droid NativeActivity example, I hope to 
create a simple C++ framework for trying out Native Activity
programming using C++ and the Nexus 7.  

IDE on the Nexus 7 is usually C4Droid + vim in TerminalIDE.  
AIDE is another alternative.

(Platform, IDE and language choices are driven by a daily commute
into London on the train from Cambridge)
